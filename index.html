        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>   Although websites have been seen to be useful there is a couple inconveniences that have been noted on multiple websites, such as their lack of needed information, most businesses tend to showcase the information they deem important therefore ignoring what some users might be needing, this tends to confuse and frustrate the users leading them to log off or find better alternatives. Another problem most websites face is their lack of customer support, although multiple business have now fixed this issue it is still a recurring issue in websites, this means that most users donâ€™t know who to approach with their inquires causing most users to then exit the website.</p>
